Farmer: I walk up and down this tiny farm daily, checking on vegetables that never change? 
Farmer: Will someone explain what is happening? Is this good? Or is their unchanging status bad? I feel lost.  
Farmer: Perhaps I should just accept it as a sign I am the best farmer ever.

    Farmer: ...A vegetable? All yours, if you come back soon.

Farmer: It's good to see you, my friend. 
<<setsprite Farmer angry>>
