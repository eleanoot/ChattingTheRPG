# ChattingTheRPG
A small RPG overworld in Unity testing the Yarn Spinner dialogue engine, inventory system, and save system.

The folders include the YarnSpinner dialogue engine used for conversations within the project, featuring my own extensions. The extended versions of the files can be found within the Examples/DemoScripts as tutorial extensions, including the sprite holder addition in the UI for character portraits, the skipping of text and sound effects within the UI, and making stored dialogue variables serializeable.
